## 🔐 Featured Projects

### 🧠 EntroPy — Entropy-Based Password Generator
EntroPy is a cutting-edge password generator that leverages real entropy to produce highly secure and unpredictable passwords. Unlike traditional generators that rely on pseudo-random algorithms, EntroPy taps into entropy sources to ensure maximum randomness and resistance to brute-force attacks.

---

**Key Features:**
- 🔒 **Entropy-Driven Security**: Uses real entropy to avoid predictable patterns.
- 🧪 **Custom Algorithms**: Designed for cryptographic strength and uniqueness.
- 🧠 **Security-Oriented Design**: Ideal for developers, researchers, and cybersecurity professionals.
- 📦 **Repository**: [EntroPy](https://github.com/gerivanc/entropy-password-generator)
- 💾 **View the code in action**: [Python](https://github.com/gerivanc/entropy-password-generator/blob/main/entropy_password_generator/password_generator.py)
